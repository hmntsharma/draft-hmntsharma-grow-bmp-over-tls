       BMPS: Transport Layer Security for BGP Monitoring Protocol
                  draft-hmntsharma-bmp-over-tls-latest

Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines the communication between a
   BMP station and multiple routers, referred to as network elements
   (NEs).  This document describes BMP over TLS, which uses Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) to ensure secure transport between the NE and
   the BMP monitoring station.  It updates [RFC7854] regarding BMP
   session establishment and termination.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP), as defined in [RFC7854],
   facilitates communication between NEs and a BMP station.  Keeping
   this communication secure is important because it includes sharing
   sensitive information about BGP peers and monitored prefixes.

   The Section 11 of [RFC7854] , "Security Considerations" acknowledges
   that while routes in public networks are generally not confidential,
   BGP is also utilized in private L3VPN [RFC4364] networks where
   confidentiality is crucial.  It highlights that without mutual
   authentication through secure transport mechanisms, the channel is
   vulnerable to various attacks and recommends using IPSec [RFC4303] in
   tunnel mode with pre-shared keys for enhanced security in such
   scenarios.

   Additionally, a recent draft proposal, [draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tcp-ao],
   titled "TCP-AO Protection for BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)" suggests
   an alternative approach using the TCP Authentication Option
   [RFC5925].  This method authenticates the endpoints of the TCP
   session, thereby safeguarding its integrity.  TCP-AO is beneficial in
   situations where full IPSec security may not be feasible, although
   unlike IPSec, it does not encrypt the session traffic.

   Alternatively, Transport Layer Security (TLS), offers endpoint
   authentication, data encryption, and data integrity defined in the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3 [RFC8446].

   This document describes how to utilize TLS to secure BMP sessions
   between a monitoring station (acting as the server) and a Network
   Element (acting as the client).  Unlike BGP, where either side can
   act as the server, BMP's role distinction simplifies the
   implementation of TLS in a client-server model.  Henceforth, the term
   BMP over TLS will be referred to as BMPS.

3.  BMP over TLS (BMPS)

3.1.  Operational Summary

   The operation of BMPS is virtually the same as the original BMP
   specification defined in [RFC7854], but with an additional layer of
   security using TLS.

   In BMPS, the BMP station functions as the TLS server, while NEs act
   as TLS clients.  Following the completion of the TCP three-way
   handshake, as defined in Section 3.4 of [RFC793], each NE,
   functioning as a TLS client, initiates a TLS handshake with the BMP
   monitoring station, acting as the TLS server.  Once the TLS
   connection is successfully established, NEs can immediately start
   transmitting BMP messages, as there is no separate BMP initiation or
   handshake phase.

   The following steps summarize the operational flow of BMPS:

   1.  The NE initiates and completes a TCP handshake.

   2.  The NE initiates and completes a TLS handshake with the BMP
       monitoring station.

   3.  BMP messages are transmitted by the NE according to [RFC7854].

   A BMPS session ends when the underlying TCP or TLS session is
   terminated for any reason.

   The Section 3.2 of [RFC7854] states, "No BMP message is ever sent
   from the monitoring station to the router."  To adhere to this
   standard, the monitoring station MUST listen on separate ports for
   BMP (non-TLS) and BMPS (TLS) sessions.  This approach also offers a
   simplified "make before break" migration from BMP to BMPS.

3.2.  Transport Layer Security

   In regular TLS connections, the server has a TLS certificate along
   with a public/private key pair, whereas the client does not.

   For BMP over TLS (BMPS), it is REQUIRED to implement mutual TLS
   (mTLS), wherein both the server (BMP station) and the client (network
   element) have certificates, and both sides authenticate each other
   using their respective public/private key pairs.

   A self-signed "root" TLS certificate is REQUIRED for mTLS, allowing
   an organization to act as its own certificate authority.  The
   certificates issued to both the BMP station and NEs should correspond
   to this root certificate.

   The operational flow of BMP over TLS is similar to standard TLS
   operations:

   1.  The NE initiates the connection to the BMP station.

   2.  The station presents its TLS certificate.

   3.  The NE verifies the station's certificate.

   4.  The NE presents its TLS certificate.

   5.  The station verifies the NE's certificate.

   6.  The TLS connection is established.

   7.  The NE begins transmitting BMP data to the station over the
       encrypted TLS channel.

   TLS version 1.3, defined in [RFC8446], streamlines the handshake
   process and supports more robust cipher suites compared to the
   previous versions, enhancing both speed and security.

   The BMPS is REQUIRED to support TLS 1.3 which has become a dominant
   standard.

3.3.  Operational Recommendations for BMPS

   The BMP over TLS (BMPS) is RECOMMENDED as an alternative mechanism to
   safeguard BMP sessions in scenarios where alternative protections
   like IPSec may not be feasible or deployed.

4.  Security Considerations

   The BMPS implementation increases computational demands due to
   continuous encryption and decryption processes, resulting in high CPU
   utilization and potential vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks.

   The TLS cipher suites that provide only data integrity validation
   without encryption SHOULD NOT be used by default.

   The BMPS implementation SHOULD follow the best practices and
   recommendations for using TLS, as per the Recommendations for Secure
   Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) as defined in [RFC7525].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
